# Damian's Authentic, Straight From The Heart of South Texas, Pambazos

## Ingredients

- 2 potatoes  
- 3 guajillo peppers, seeds and veins removed  
- 2 chorizos (3 oz. each)  
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil  
- 1 garlic clove  
- 8 black peppercorns  
- 1/4 teaspoon Mexican oregano  
- 6 teleras or bolillos, sliced lengthwise  
- 1 1/2 cups shredded iceberg lettuce  
- 1/4 cup crumbled cheese  
- 2 tablespoons Mexican cream  
- Salt to taste  

## Instructions

1. Place the potatoes in a pot of boiling hot water. Leave for 15 minutes.  
   - For softer potatoes, boil longer.  
   - For firmer potatoes, boil for a minimum of 10 minutes.  

2. While potatoes are cooking, soak guajillo peppers in hot water to soften.

3. In the meantime, cook the chorizo in a skillet over medium-high heat.  
   - It will be ready in about 8 minutes.

4. Once the potatoes are done, drain and remove from pot.

5. Begin mashing the potatoes slightly.  
   - Don't fully mash yet; you'll mix them with the chorizo next.

6. Add mashed potatoes to the skillet with the cooked chorizo.  
   - Cook for 3 minutes, mixing well to combine flavors and soften potatoes further.  
   - Set aside.

7. In a blender, combine:  
   - Soaked guajillo peppers  
   - 1 cup of the soaking water  
   - Garlic clove  
   - Oregano  
   - Peppercorns  
   - Blend until smooth.  
   - Strain and place in a bowl.

8. Heat a griddle and add 1/2 tablespoon of oil.

9. Place the sliced rolls upside down and brush their tops with guajillo salsa.

10. Flip the bolillo so the tops get a little warm and crispy.  
    - About 1 minute per side.  
    - Repeat for all rolls, adding more oil as needed.

11. **Assemble the Pambazos:**  
    - Place chorizo-potato mixture on each toasted bolillo.  
    - Top with shredded lettuce, cream, and cheese.  
    - Serve with hot salsa.  

**Enjoy!**
