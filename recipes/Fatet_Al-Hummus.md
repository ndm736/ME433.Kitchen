My SO prefers to eat gluten free, and I love buying bananas and not eating them before they go bad, so this is what I do with them. Makes 12 muffins.

### Ingredients
- 3 cups Chickpeas
- 4 loaves Arabic Bread
- 2T Garlic (crushed)
- 1/2 cup Lemon Juice
- 2T Tahini
- 1/4 cup Yogurt
- 1t Salt
- 1/4T Cumin
- 1/2 cup Pine nuts (toasted)
- 1T Parsley (finely chopped)

### Instructions
1. Keep 1/2 cup of cooked chickpeas into a bowl.
2. Combine Tahini, lemon juice, yogurt, and, if needed, water in food processor; blend.
3. Add garlic and salt.
4. Add in chickpeas and blend well.
5. Cut bread into small pieces and place in a serving bowl.
6. Mix half of chickpeas liquid with bread, then add the other half.
7. Garnish with chickpeas, cumin, parsley, and pine nuts.

Enjoy!
