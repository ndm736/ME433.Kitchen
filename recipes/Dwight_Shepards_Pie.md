# Dwight Shepard’s Pie

This is the Shepard’s pie I make in the summer when the sweet corn in my hometown of Dwight, IL is being harvested and sold at the farmer’s market or given as a gift. You can make it with specific/fresh ingredients or with cheap stuff from the grocery store, most things can be substituted to taste.
