\f0\fs24 \cf0 # Dwight Shepard\'92s Pie\
\
This is the Shepard\'92s pie I make in the summer when the sweet corn in my hometown of Dwight, IL is being harvested and sold at the farmer\'92s market or given as a gift. You can make it with specific/fresh ingredients or with cheap stuff from the grocery store, most things can be substituted to taste.  \
