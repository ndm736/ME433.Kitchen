My SO prefers to eat gluten free, and I love buying bananas and not eating them before they go bad, so this is what I do with them. Makes 12 muffins.

### Ingredients
- 3 eggs
- 1 avocado
- 4 small chicken sausages
- 1 tablespoon avocado oil
- 1 teaspoon truffle oil

### Instructions
1. Cook 3 eggs overeasy 
2. Mash the avocado and add salt/pepper
3. Cook sausages for 3 minutes in the same pan as the eggs
4. once everything is cooked, put a little truffle oil over everything to add flavor 
Enjoy!
