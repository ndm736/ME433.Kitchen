# Scallion Oil Chicken  
by Li-Wen Chang
Cooking time ~1.5 hr

## Ingredients

- 1 whole chicken (around 3–4 lbs)
- 3 tablespoons salt (for scrubbing)
- 4–5 slices fresh ginger
- 2 stalks scallions, tied into knots
- Water (enough to submerge the chicken)

### Scallion Oil Sauce:
- 1/2 cup finely chopped scallions (green part only)
- 1 tablespoon finely minced ginger
- 1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
- 1/3 cup hot vegetable oil

## Instructions

Rub the whole chicken with salt to exfoliate the skin, then rinse thoroughly under cold water.

Place chicken in a large pot with enough water to cover. Add ginger slices and knotted scallions. Bring to a gentle boil over medium heat, then reduce to a low simmer. Cover and poach the chicken for about 45 minutes to 1 hour, until fully cooked.

Carefully remove chicken and place in an ice bath or run under cold water to tighten the skin. Let rest and cool completely before cutting into serving pieces.

### Make the Scallion Oil Sauce:

In a heatproof bowl, combine chopped scallions, minced ginger, and salt. Heat vegetable oil in a small pan until it’s shimmering but not smoking. Carefully pour hot oil over the scallion-ginger mixture. It should sizzle. Stir to combine.

Serve chicken cold or room temperature, topped with generous spoonfuls of the scallion oil sauce.
