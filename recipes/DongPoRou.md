# Dong Po Rou (Braised Pork Belly)
### By Jonathan Wu

Here's a recipe for Braised Pork Belly, a.k.a Dong Po Rou, that I would often eat whenever I visit my relatives in China.

## Ingredients
2 pound slab of pork belly (900g)
3 bunches scallions (washed and cut in half lengthwise)
8 slices ginger
2 cups Shaoxing wine
2/3 cup light soy sauce
2 1/2 tablespoons dark soy sauce
4-5 oz. rock sugar (depending on desired level of sweetness)

## Instructions
1. Wash the pork belly as a whole piece. Blanch it whole in boiling water for one minute and drain.
2. Cut the pork into 3 x 3 inch pieces. You can also make them 2 x 2 inches if you like them smaller. Set aside.
3. In a medium clay pot (preferably) or a medium (4-quart) regular pot, lay the scallions on the bottom in a thick, even layer. The scallions should cover the entire bottom of the pot. Space the ginger slices evenly over the scallions.
4. Lay the pork belly skin-side down on top of the ginger and scallions. Pour over the Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, and dark soy sauce. Add the rock sugar to the pot as well.
5. Cover the pot and place it over medium high heat. Once the liquid in the pot comes to a boil, immediately turn down the heat to low and simmer for 90 minutes.
6. After 90 minutes, turn the pork belly skin-side up in the pot, cover, and let simmer for another 90 minutes at the lowest heat.

Enjoy!
