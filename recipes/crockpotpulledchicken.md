## Crock-Pot Pulled Chicken
<!---

A friend of mine had a crockpot for 3 years and never used it so I asked if I could give it a try. I was hoping to make better chicken with less effort. It worked out really well and I'm a huge fan! The amount of ingredients is pretty variable depending on how many people you want to serve. 

### Ingredients
- 3lbs of chicken
- Salt
- Pepper
- Chicken stock
- Oregano
- Basil

### Instructions
1. Using a skillet, brown the chicken on both sides
2. Place the chicken in the crockpot, it's best to not stack it if possible. Put all the spices and chicken broth on top.
3. Cook for 3-3.5 hours on low (use a thermometer to see when internal temp reaches 165 degrees)
4. Using two forks, pull the chicken while it is still in the crockpot. 

Enjoy!
