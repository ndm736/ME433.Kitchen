## Chris Jung's Budae-jjigae

You kind of just use whatever you have for the most part, but I like to add as much as my wok/pot can fit (these measurements are just suggestions). The following are some typical ingredients I like to use. This is meant to feed 4-6 people.

### Ingredients
- 3 cups anchovy stock (I like to use anchovy stock tablets)
- 6 minced garlic cloves
- 1 tablespoon gochujang
- 2 tablespoon gochugaru
- 1 teaspoon soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon sugar
- 2 tablespoon water
- 1/2 lb pork belly or pork shoulder
- 4 oz spam, sliced thinly
- 4 weiners, cut thinly
- 1 pack instant ramen noodles
- 12-16 rice cakes
- 1 pack firm tofu
- 1/2 cup fermented kimchi
- 1/2 medium onion, sliced
- 2 green onion, sliced small
- 1 stalk enoki mushroom
- 1/2 radish (sliced)
- American cheese

### Instructions
1. For seasoning paste, mix the garlic, gochugaru, gochujang, soy sauce, sugar, and water. However, a lot of my friends think this recipe is a little too spicy, so cut back on the gochugaru.
2. Spread out all the other ingredients besides the ramen, rice cakes, cheese, and green onion in a big pot ( I use a wok for more surface area). I usually group them all in batches.
3. Add three cups of the anchovy stock and mix in the seasoning paste.
4. Let it boil and simmer for a long while (covered).
5. Near the end, throw in the ramen and rice cakes.
6. Top it off with the American cheese (cover so it steams and melts on top) and green onion.

Enjoy!
