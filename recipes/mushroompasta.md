## 🍳 Instructions

1. **Cook the pasta**  
   Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.

2. **Sauté aromatics**  
   In a large skillet over medium heat, heat olive oil. Add garlic and onion, and sauté for 2–3 minutes until fragrant and soft.

3. **Add mushrooms**  
   Stir in sliced mushrooms, thyme, and chili flakes (if using). Cook for 7–8 minutes until mushrooms are browned and their moisture has evaporated.

4. **Make the sauce**  
   Reduce heat to low. Pour in the heavy cream and stir well. Let it simmer for 3–4 minutes, then stir in Parmesan cheese until melted and the sauce thickens slightly.

5. **Combine pasta and sauce**  
   Add cooked pasta to the skillet. Toss to coat evenly. Season with salt and pepper. Add lemon zest for brightness if desired.

6. **Garnish and serve**  
   Sprinkle chopped parsley on top. Serve hot with extra Parmesan on the side.
