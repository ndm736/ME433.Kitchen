### Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1⁄2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1⁄2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon cream of tartar
- 1⁄2 teaspoon salt
- 3⁄4 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg, plus one egg yolk
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1⁄4 cup granulated sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1⁄2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 1⁄2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

### Instructions
Make the Cheesecake Filling
1. In a medium sized mixing bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.
2. Place the bowl of cheese cake filling mixture into the refrigerator for 5 hours, or until the cream cheese has firmed up. I make the mixture the evening before I plan to bake and allow it to set up in the refrigerator overnight.

Make the Cookie Dough
3. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C) and line a cookie sheet with parchment paper to prevent the cookies from sticking.
4. In a medium sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cream of tartar, and salt until fully combined. Set the dry ingredients aside.
5. In a separate mixing bowl, cream the softened butter and sugar together until light and fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes on medium high speed.
6. Beat in the egg and egg yolk one at a time, ensuring each is well incorporated before adding the next, followed by the vanilla extract.
7. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture. Mix together until just combined and a soft dough forms.

Assemble and Bake the Cookies
8. Divide the cookie dough into portions that are roughly 2 tablespoons each.
9. Take a ball of cookie dough and use your fingers to flatten the ball of dough into a disc like shape. Then scoop 2 teaspoons of the chilled cheesecake filling into the center of your flattened piece of cookie dough.
10. Carefully wrap the dough around the cheesecake filling, ensuring no filling is exposed, and roll into a smooth ball.
11. Combine the granulated sugar and cinnamon for the cinnamon sugar coating in a small bowl, then roll each cookie ball in the mixture until fully coated.
12. Arrange the cinnamon sugar coated cookie balls on the prepared baking sheet, spacing them about 2 inches apart from each other.
13. Bake in the preheated oven for 11-13 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown, then remove from oven to cool.
