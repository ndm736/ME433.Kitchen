It is sad that people do not give this sandwich a chance, as it is pretty good! I recommend this recipe
for anyone looking to elevate their sandwich game.


### Ingredients
- Bread (2 slices)
- Pickles (sliced)
- Peanut Butter (a few tablespoons)

### Instructions
1. Lay out the two pieces of bread on a plate
2. Evenly spread the peanut butter onto one of the sides of one of the pieces of bread
3. Lay the slices of pickles evenly on one side of the other piece of bread
4. Bring the sides of the bread with the PB and the pickles together so that the bread slices are stacked on top of each other.
5. Enjoy your sandwich!
