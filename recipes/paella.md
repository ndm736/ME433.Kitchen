### Ingredients

- **2 tablespoons** olive oil  
- **1 pound** (450 g) chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces  
- **1 pound** (450 g) shrimp, peeled and deveined  
- **1 teaspoon** smoked paprika  
- **1 teaspoon** salt (plus more to taste)  
- **½ teaspoon** freshly ground black pepper  
- **1 onion**, finely chopped  
- **3 cloves** garlic, minced  
- **1 red bell pepper**, sliced  
- **1 cup** (approx. 200 g) fresh or frozen peas  
- **2 cups** (approx. 370 g) short-grain rice (e.g., Bomba or Arborio)  
- **4 cups** (950 ml) chicken or seafood stock (warm)  
- **½ teaspoon** saffron threads (soaked in 2 tablespoons warm water)  
- **Lemon wedges** (for garnish)  
- **Fresh parsley**, chopped (for garnish)  

### Instructions

1. **Heat the pan**  
   - Warm a wide, heavy-bottomed paella pan (or large skillet) over medium-high heat.  
   - Add the olive oil.

2. **Brown the chicken**  
   - Season the chicken pieces with half the smoked paprika, salt, and pepper.  
   - Add the chicken to the pan and cook until lightly browned, about 5–7 minutes.  
   - Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.

3. **Cook the shrimp**  
   - Season the shrimp with a pinch of salt and the remaining smoked paprika.  
   - Cook the shrimp in the same pan for about 2 minutes on each side, just until pink.  
   - Remove and set aside with the chicken.

4. **Sauté aromatics**  
   - Add the chopped onion, garlic, and sliced red bell pepper to the pan.  
   - Cook until the onions become translucent, about 5 minutes.

5. **Combine rice and broth**  
   - Stir the rice into the sautéed vegetables to coat and toast the grains slightly.  
   - Add the warm chicken or seafood stock along with the saffron threads (and their soaking water).  
   - Season with additional salt and pepper if needed.

6. **Simmer and add protein**  
   - Return the chicken pieces to the pan, nestling them into the rice.  
   - Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about 15 minutes, uncovered.  
   - Once the rice starts to absorb most of the liquid, gently stir in the peas.  
   - Arrange the shrimp on top of the rice.  
   - Continue to cook for another 5–10 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.

7. **Rest and serve**  
   - Turn off the heat, cover the pan with aluminum foil or a lid, and let the paella rest for about 5 minutes.  
   - Garnish with freshly chopped parsley and lemon wedges.  
   - Serve hot and enjoy!

**Tip:** For a more authentic crispy bottom (known as the *socarrat*), let the paella cook a bit longer over low heat without stirring during the last few minutes of cooking.
