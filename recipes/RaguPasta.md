# Ryan's Ragu Pasta Recipe
This is a simple pasta recipe you can use for a quick meal. You can also pretty easily make a big batch of sauce and portion it into ziploc bags to meal prep for the week. 

## Ingredients
* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 jar (24 oz) Ragu pasta sauce
* 8 oz pasta (spaghetti, penne, or your choice)
* Salt and pepper
* Garlic powder, onion powder, Italian seasoning (optional)
* Fresh parsley or basil (optional)
* Grated Parmesan (optional)

## Instructions
1. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef, season with salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Italian seasoning. Cook until browned and fully cooked (6-8 minutes). Drain excess fat if needed.
2. While the beef cooks, boil salted water and cook pasta according to package instructions. Drain, reserving 1 cup of pasta water.
3. Pour Ragu pasta sauce into the skillet with the cooked beef. Stir and simmer for 5-10 minutes.
4. Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the sauce. Toss to coat the pasta in the sauce. Add reserved pasta water to adjust consistency if needed.
5. Plate the pasta.
6. Top with fresh parsley or basil and Parmesan cheese, if desired.

Enjoy!
