#  Josh's Chicken Quesadilla Recipe

## Ingredients

- 1 cup grilled chicken
- 1 cup shredded mexican cheese blend
- 10 in. flour tortilla
- 1/2 cup corn (optional)
- 1/2 cup brown rice (optional)
- Queso sauce
- Salt

## Instructions

Prep your fillings:
If your chicken isn't pre-cooked, season and cook it in a pan until done, then dice or shred it. Cook your rice if you are planning to add it.

Assemble the quesadilla:
Lay one tortilla flat. On one half, layer:

1/2 cup cheese

1/2 cup chicken

1/4 cup corn

1/4 cup brown rice

Another layer of cheese (for max meltiness)

A final layer of queso dip/sauce

Fold the tortilla in half to make a half-moon shape.

Cook it up:
Heat a skillet over medium heat and add oil or butter. Place the quesadilla in the pan and cook for 2â€“3 minutes on each side, until golden brown and the cheese is melty.

Slice and serve:
Remove from heat, let sit for a minute, then slice into wedges. Serve hot with your favorite toppings.
