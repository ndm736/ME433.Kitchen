## Ikuradon (Salmon Roe Rice Bowl)
Ikuradon (いくら丼) is a simple yet decadent Japanese dish featuring seasoned salmon roe (ikura) served over a bowl of warm rice. It's salty, savory, and loaded with umami. Makes 1 serving. Try to make this or order it in a restaurant and it won't disappoint!

### Ingredients
- 1/2 cup ikura (salmon roe), chilled
- 1 cup freshly cooked Japanese short-grain rice
- 1 sheet nori (seaweed), sliced into thin strips
- Optional: 1 shiso leaf or a few sprigs of mitsuba
- Optional: wasabi or grated fresh ginger on the side
- Optional: soy sauce (use sparingly!)

### Instructions
1. Cook the rice and let it cool slightly — it should be warm but not steaming hot (to avoid cooking the roe).
2. Place the warm rice in a serving bowl.
3. Gently scoop the ikura and place it over the center of the rice.
4. Garnish with sliced nori and optional shiso leaf or mitsuba.
5. Serve with a small dab of wasabi or ginger on the side.
6. (Optional) Drizzle a tiny splash of soy sauce — but not too much! The ikura is already seasoned.
7. Eat immediately while the rice is warm and the ikura is cold and popping with flavor.
