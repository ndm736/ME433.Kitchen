## Michael's Flourless Chocolate Cake

I love gluten, but my roomate is supposedly "lactose intolerant" so I found this tasty chocolate cake recipe so he can have some. 

### Ingredients (serves 2)
- 8 large eggs, cold
- 1 pound dark or semisweet chocolate, coarsely chopped
- 1 cup (2 sticks) salted butter, cut into 16 pieces
- optional toppings (but I always use them): powdered sugar and berries

### Instructions
1. Heat the oven to 325°F. Line the bottom of an 8-inch (ideally springform) pan with parchment paper and grease the sides of the pan. Set the pan in a larger roasting pan.
2. Bring a kettle or pot of water to boil.
3. In a stand mixer using the whisk attachment, beat the eggs at high speed until the volume doubles. This usually takes about 5 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate and butter together. You can do this in the microwave (by heating the chocolate and butter in a microwave-safe bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the chocolate and butter are melted and smooth). Take care not to overheat the chocolate – you only want to heat it enough so that the chocolate *just* melts. 
5. Fold about a third of the beaten eggs into the chocolate mixture using a rubber spatula until only a few streaks of egg are visible. Fold in half of the remaining egg foam, and then the last half of the foam, until the mixture is totally homogenous. Do not overstir.
6. Scrape the batter into the prepared springform pan and smooth the surface with a rubber spatula. Place the roasting pan on the oven rack and VERY carefully pour in enough boiling water to come about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until the sides of the cake begin to pull away from the edges of the pan. Carefully remove the pan from the water bath and set it on a wire rack; cool to room temperature. Cover and refrigerate until completely chilled. 
7. About 30 minutes prior to serving, run a knife around the edges of the cake and carefully remove the sides of the springform pan. Carefully slip a spatula under the parchment to loosen and remove the pan base and transfer the cake to a serving platter. If desired, lightly dust the cake with powdered sugar and top with berries.
